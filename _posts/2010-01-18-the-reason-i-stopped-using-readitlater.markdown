title: The reason I stopped using ReadItLater
---

<p>ReadItLater is an amazing web app that lets you save articles so that you can Read them later. There is a Firefox extension, a bookmarklet for other browsers and an iPhone app which is pretty baddass. However there is one big flaw: (lack of) organization. I have about 150 articles I have to read and they're all listed chronologically. It's pretty simple to find an article using the ajax-powered search bar but when you have 150+ articles to read, you don't remember what they are.</p>
<p>I then tried Instapaper. It's a pretty new app, a ReadItLater clone with a couple extra feature, one of which is folders. You can organise your articles in folder, but you can't add them to a specific folder directly which is not convenient at all. In addition to that, in the FAQs there is a paragraph saying that Instapaper is not made to "keep" articles, it just saves them temporarily.</p>
<p>After a little bit of thinking, I figured out that what I was actually looking for already existed: Delicious. I now use it the same way I used ReadItLater on the web, the same way I use Yojimbo on my mac.</p>
