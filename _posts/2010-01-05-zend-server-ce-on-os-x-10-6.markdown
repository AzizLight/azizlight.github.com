title: Zend Server CE on OS X 10.6
---

For the past couple months I have been using [MAMP PRO](http://mamp.info "MAMP PRO"). I like it quite a bit I have to say, but I love trying new things.

For some reason I wanted to try [Zend Server CE](http://www.zend.com/en/products/server-ce/ "Zend Server CE"). I downloaded it, installed it, worked like a charm. Then I tried to add some files: a pain in the ass. I haven't tried hard enough but it doesn't work "out of the box". I have only used it for a couple days (hours actually) and I will continue to test it more extensively to get a good idea of what I actually love/hate about it.

One thing that does bother me though: Zend doesn't have an IRC channel (unless I don't know about it, which is far from impossible) so getting fast support is not really possible. Forums support is very slow (and very web 1.0) and email is ... well S-L-O-O-O-O-O-W (and very ... web 0.1).
