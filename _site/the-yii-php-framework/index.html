		<p>I have been using CodeIgniter since mid-August 2009 and I absolutely love it. However, I get bored very easily, I like change, so I decided I would look for another PHP framework that had a little more functionality baked in. I had tried CakePHP before trying CodeIgniter and I didn&#8217;t really like it; I thought it was too bloated. After a little bit of research, a couple framework look really appealing to me. Here is the full list along with links to their home page:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href='http://kohanaphp.com/'>Kohana</a></li>

<li><a href='http://www.recessframework.org/'>Recess</a></li>

<li><a href='http://doophp.com/'>DooPHP</a></li>

<li><a href='http://www.dingoframework.com/'>Dingo</a></li>

<li><a href='http://www.yiiframework.com/'>Yii</a></li>

<li><a href='http://www.solarphp.com/'>Solar</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I haven&#8217;t actually tried all of those frameworks, but they all look really appealing and I know that at some point I am going to use them all to create a website. All those frameworks are PHP 5 only. Dingo and Kohana are the ones that are the most similar to CodeIgniter and I didn&#8217;t really played around with Solar or DooPHP, but I looked at the source of all the frameworks and they all look well written with clean code, indentation, comments, etc.</p>

<p>Recess and Yii stand out though. Especially Recess. However, Recess is not maintained as regularly as Yii. Now I won&#8217;t really talk exentsively about Recess, I&#8217;m just going to say that you can generate Models and Controllers via a web interface or a command line utility (which is really cool) and that it has a RESTful API (which is even cooler).</p>

<p>Yii also has a command line tool that is very simple, very straight forward. It&#8217;s very similar to Rails without the bloat. It&#8217;s modular, it supports relationships, it&#8217;s a rapid developement framework that is also lightweight and faster than CodeIgniter, I love it. The cherry on the cake is that it has a really nice documentation, especially a couple Guides that you can download in PDF and that will teach you to build a blog for instance. Finally, when you download Yii it comes with a <em>demos</em> folder where you can find a couple web apps built with Yii to give the user a good exemple of how the framework works.</p>

<p>I only mentioned some of the nice features of Yii, and it would be a shame to just trust me when I say that it&#8217;s an awesome framework, you should try it!</p>

<p>Final note: I still love CodeIgniter and will probably never stop using it unless I have to. But I also like to try new things.</p>
