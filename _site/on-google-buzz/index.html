		<p>I have been using Google Buzz for about a week, or at least I tried. Before I start laying down my thoughts on the latest application of the big G, I will say the following: I don&#8217;t like Buzz and have completely disabled it since last friday; I also deleted my profile.</p>

<p>Buzz has several big defects in my opinion. First of all, it&#8217;s yet another micro-blogging web application, which I don&#8217;t need. I just started using Twitter a couple months ago and I don&#8217;t have any good reason to replace it with Buzz, or to use tow web apps that do the same thing. Second of all, in Buzz, I might follow who ever I want, but doing so got a ton of crap to my attention too. Let me put it this way: I don&#8217;t think that the &#8220;conversation&#8221; aspect of Buzz is any interesting, in fact, it&#8217;s what made me stop using Buzz. I was following a dozen people I was already following on Twitter and what I got in return is the reactions to their &#8220;buzzes&#8221; by all their followers; by following one person you also get the reactions of all their followers even if you don&#8217;t follow them.</p>

<p>I think I made my self clear on the previous point. But to further illustrate it, here what bothered me the most about it: the +1000 near the Buzz menu item in the sidebar even though I was following one tenth of the people I follow on twitter&#8230;</p>

<p>To compare that same feature to twitter, in twitter, not only don&#8217;t I see the tweets of the people I don&#8217;t follow, but I also don&#8217;t see the tweets of the people I follow if they address themselves directly somebody I don&#8217;t follow (using the @ sign).</p>

<p>Finally, Buzz doesn&#8217;t have any clients, and it&#8217;s a pain in the ass to go to Gmail every time I want to see new buzzes.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I will repeat something I said at the beginning of my post: I don&#8217;t like Buzz&#8230;</p>
